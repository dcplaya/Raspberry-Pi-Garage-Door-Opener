Garage door operation and safety:
  Since this code may control external devices, in this case an electric garage door opener, 
  It is up to the end user to make sure that their garage door has all of its 
  safety features installed and working properly.  If you do not have a door opener 
  with safety sensors, like optical obstruction sensors, or a door pressure 
  auto-reverse feature, do not install this to your garage door.  Serious injury or death can
  occur without these protection mechanisms in place.
